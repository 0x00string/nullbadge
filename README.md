I have uploaded the hex file for the Dye. I encourage you all to make this badge unique and your own. That being said, I have also written this firmware for it, which will require you to earn points by playing games in order to unlock different LED patterns. You can easily skip all of this, and write your own firmware for it. You could even use the Arduino IDE if you wanted to.

Details about badge sales will be announced on twitter, but not by @0x00string. Have lots of fun, HACK THE PLANET!
